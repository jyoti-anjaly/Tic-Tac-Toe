# Tic-Tac-Toe
Made my first project using C++ language  with the help of one tutorial.
First of all, you have to select your game mode that is in which game mode you want to play : 1. Computer vs Player
                                                                                              2. Player vs Player.
After selecting, go ahead , enter your name or the player's name and enjoy the game.
